<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>What is Bride Studio?</h3>

By uploading a single photo and selecting a dress style, you can see a realistic preview of how you might look as a bride.

Some advanced features, premium dress styles, or higher-quality generations

</p>

<h3>How does the AI work?</h3>
<p>
Bride Studio uses artificial intelligence to analyze your uploaded photo and
generate a realistic wedding dress preview.
The AI focuses on body proportions, lighting, and dress details to create a natural-looking result.
</p>

<h3>Are the generated images realistic?</h3>
<p>
The generated images are designed to be as realistic as possible.
However, results may vary depending on photo quality, lighting, posture,
and dress selection.
The images are for visualization and inspiration purposes only.
</p>

<h3>Do the dresses represent real brands or designers?</h3>
<p>
No. All dresses and images generated by Bride Studio are created by AI and
do not represent real products, designers, or fashion brands.
Any resemblance to existing designs is purely coincidental.
</p>

<h3>Are my photos stored?</h3>

Your privacy is important to us.
Uploaded photos are processed securely and are not shared publicly.
Photos are stored only for the time required to generate the result
and may be deleted automatically after processing.
