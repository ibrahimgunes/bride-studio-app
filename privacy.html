<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2025</p>

<p>
Bride Studio ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. 
This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the Bride Studio mobile application.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Photos & Face Data:</strong><br>
When you upload a photo to use the "Virtual Try-On" feature, our app processes the image to identify <strong>facial landmarks and body contours</strong>. 
This "Face Data" is used strictly to align, scale, and realistically overlay wedding dresses onto your photo.
</p>

<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong><br>
We may collect anonymous usage information such as app interactions, feature usage, and crash reports to improve app performance and stability.
</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information:</strong><br>
Bride Studio does not require you to provide sensitive personal information such as your name, address, or phone number to use the basic features of the app.
</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <h3>Special Disclosure on Face Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Identification:</strong> We do not use face data to identify the user's personal identity or for biometric authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The data is used solely for the technical simulation of bridal wear.</li>
    <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or share face data with third-party advertisers or data brokers.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>2. Firebase Services & Data Storage</h2>

<p>
Bride Studio uses <strong>Google Firebase</strong> services to operate. Your data is stored on secure Google servers.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Firebase Storage & Firestore:</strong> Used to store your uploaded profile photos and the AI-generated "tried-on" images securely.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Functions:</strong> Used to process the image transformation via our AI algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics:</strong> Used to monitor app performance and fix bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<p>
<strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your uploaded photos and generated images only as long as you maintain an active account in the app.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Deletion:</strong> You have full control over your data. You can delete your photos or your entire account at any time via the in-app settings. 
Upon deletion, all photos and associated face data are <strong>permanently removed</strong> from our Firebase Storage and Firestore databases.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
Bride Studio does not sell, rent, or trade your data. 
Data is processed only through our infrastructure providers (Google Firebase) strictly for app functionality. 
We do not disclose face data to any third parties except as required by law.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>

<p>
We use industry-standard encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect your data during transmission and at rest within Firebase. 
However, please note that no electronic transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
